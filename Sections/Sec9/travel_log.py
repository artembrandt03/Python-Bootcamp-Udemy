teacher's solution: 
def add_new_country(name, times_visited, cities_visited):
  new_country = {}
  new_country["country"] = name
  new_country["visits"] = times_visited
  new_country["cities"] = cities_visited

feedback: 
- You directly use a dictionary literal as the argument to the append() method. This is concise and often considered more readable.
- You provide the function with parameters country, visits, and list_of_cities, making the function self-contained.
- Your teacher's code explicitly creates an empty dictionary new_country and then sets its keys and values before appending it to the travel_log.
The function takes parameters name, times_visited, and cities_visited, which are then used to populate the dictionary.
