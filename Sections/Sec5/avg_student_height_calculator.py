#the challenge was not to use sum() and len() functions, but if i could the solution would be like this:
#total_height = sum(student_heights)
#num_of_students = len(student_heights)
#avg_height = round(total_height/num_of_students)

#solution comparing to the teacher: she split the for loop in 2, for total height and num of students. 
#mine is basically more efficient
